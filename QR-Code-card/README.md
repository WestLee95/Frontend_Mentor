## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5** 
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox** for layout
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of responsive design principles and the simplicity of creating visually appealing, minimalistic components. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Using Tailwind CSS for Layout and Styling:**
   Tailwind CSS's utility classes allowed me to rapidly style the component with clarity and precision.
   ```html
   <body class="flex justify-center items-center overflow-hidden min-w-[375px] min-h-[800px] max-w-[1440px] max-h-[800px]">
   ```
2. **Typography with Google Fonts:**
   I incorporated the "Outfit" font seamlessly into the project:
   ```html
   <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
   ```

3. **Organising the QR Code Component:**
   Using semantic and accessible HTML elements, I ensured proper structure and readability for the page.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to focus on:

- Exploring advanced Tailwind CSS concepts, such as custom themes.
- Implementing animations to enhance user interaction.
- Adopting component-based libraries like React for better scalability.

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This was essential for understanding and applying utility classes.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - To find and implement clean, modern fonts.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - A platform for honing frontend skills with practical challenges.
